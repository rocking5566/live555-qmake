Version: 2017.09.12
The "LIVE555 Media Server" is a complete RTSP server application. It can stream several kinds of media file (which must be stored in the current working directory - i.e., the directory from which you launch the application - or a subdirectory.):
 - A MPEG Transport Stream file (with file name suffix ".ts")
 - A Matroska or WebM file (with filename suffix ".mkv" or ".webm")
 - An Ogg) file (with filename suffix ".ogg", "ogv", or ".opus")
 - A MPEG-1 or 2 Program Stream file (with file name suffix ".mpg")
 - A MPEG-4 Video Elementary Stream file (with file name suffix ".m4e")
 - A H.264 Video Elementary Stream file (with file name suffix ".264")
 - A H.265 Video Elementary Stream file (with file name suffix ".265")
 - A VOB video+audio file (with file name suffix ".vob")
 - A DV video file (with file name suffix ".dv")
 - A MPEG-1 or 2 (including layer III - i.e., 'MP3') audio file (with file name suffix ".mp3")
 - A WAV (PCM) audio file (with file name suffix ".wav")
 - An AMR audio file (with file name suffix ".amr")
 - An AC-3 audio file (with file name suffix ".ac3")
 - An AAC (ADTS format) audio file (with file name suffix ".aac")
 
These streams can be received/played by standards-compliant RTSP/RTP media clients, including:

 - VLC media player
 - QuickTime Player
 - Amino set-top boxes (for playing MPEG Transport Streams only)
 - The openRTSP command-line RTSP client (which receives/stores stream data, without playing it)

Notes:
 - The server can transmit multiple streams (from the same, or different files) concurrently
 - By default, the server transmits its streams as RTP/UDP packets. If requested by the RTSP client, the server will stream its RTP (and RTCP) packets over TCP. (This can be useful for clients that are behind a firewall.)
 - Some non-standard RTSP clients - such as Amino set-top boxes - request raw UDP streaming, rather than standard RTP streaming. Despite this, this server will accommodate such requests, and stream MPEG Transport Streams over raw-UDP, if requested.
